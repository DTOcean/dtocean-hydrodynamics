# DTOcean Hydrodynamics Module

This package provides the Hydrodynamics design module for the DTOcean tools.
It can calculate the energy output of arrays of fixed or floating wave or tidal
ocean energy converters, including the effect of interactions. It can optimise
the position of the devices for maximum energy yield, constrained by the given 
environment.

See [dtocean-app](https://github.com/DTOcean/dtocean-app) or [dtocean-core](
https://github.com/DTOcean/dtocean-app) to use this package within the DTOcean
ecosystem.

*   For python 2.7 only.

## Installation

Installation and development of dtocean-hydrodynamics uses the [Anaconda 
Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (Python 2.7)

These installation instructions are for WINDOWS ONLY.

### Conda Package

To install:

```
$ conda install -c dataonlygreater dtocean-hydrodynamics
```

### Source Code

Conda can be used to install dependencies into a dedicated environment from
the source code root directory:

```
conda create -y -n _dtocean_hydro python=2.7 pip
```

Activate the environment, then copy the `.condrc` file to store installation  
channels:

```
$ conda activate _dtocean_hydro
$ copy .condarc %CONDA_PREFIX%
```

Install [polite](https://github.com/DTOcean/polite) into the environment. For 
example, if installing it from source:

```
$ cd \\path\\to\\polite
$ conda install -y --file requirements-conda-dev.txt
$ pip install -e .
```

Some modules in dtocean-hydrodynamics must be compiled before installation.
These instructions use [mingw-w64](https://mingw-w64.org), which should be
installed first. When ready, set the MINGW_BIN_PATH environment variable to
the "bin" folder of the mingw-w64 installation. For example:

```
$ SET MINGW_BIN_PATH=C:\mingw\mingw64\bin
```

Check that the variable is set correctly:

```
$ echo %MINGW_BIN_PATH%
C:\mingw\mingw64\bin
```

The numpy and libpython packages are also required for compilation:

```
$ conda install -y numpy=1.11.3=py27hfef472a_4 libpython
```

Now compile the modules:

```
$ cd \\path\\to\\dtocean-hydrodynamics
$ python setup.py bootstrap
```

Finally, install dtocean-hydrodynamics and its dependencies using conda and pip:

```
$ conda install -y --file requirements-conda-dev.txt
$ pip install -e .
```

To deactivate the conda environment:

```
$ conda deactivate
```

### Data Package

When installing from source, the DTOcean data package must also be installed. 
This can either be installed using conda:

```
$ conda activate _dtocean_hydro
$ conda install dtocean-data
```

Or it can be downloaded from the [dtocean-data](https://github.com/DTOcean/dtocean-data)
repository, in the "Assets" section of the [latest release](
https://github.com/DTOcean/dtocean-data/releases/latest).

### Tests

A test suite is provided with the source code that uses [pytest](
https://docs.pytest.org).

If not already active, activate the conda environment set up in the [Source 
Code](#source-code) section:

```
$ conda activate _dtocean_hydro
```

Install pytest to the environment (one time only):

```
$ conda install -y mock pytest pytest-mock pytest-qt
```

Run the tests:

``` 
$ pytest tests
```

### Uninstall

To uninstall the conda package:

```
$ conda remove dtocean-hydrodynamics
```

To uninstall the source code and its conda environment:

```
$ conda remove --name _dtocean-hydro --all
```

To uninstall the data package use the link in the Windows start menu program
folder, or use the control panel.

## Usage

### Examples

Example scripts are available in the "examples" folder of the source code.

For tidal energy converters:

```
$ cd examples
$ python Ex_tidal_v2.py
```

For wave energy converters:

```
$ cd examples
$ python Ex_wave_v2.py
```

### Command Line Tools

A graphical user interface to the WEC analysis tool is provided. This tool is a 
required pre-processing step for analysing the interactions of wave energy 
converters. To get help: 

```
$ dtocean-wec -h
```

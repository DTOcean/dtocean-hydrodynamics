<H1>Heaving Cylinder</H1>
<H2>General Description</H2>
<P> The device used in this example is a single degree of freedom WEC, 
<P> of a point abosrber type.

<H2>Geometry</H2>
<P> The wec is a cylinder with radius 5 m and draft 10 m.
<P> The mesh of the submerged part of the structure is show in the figure below.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="img/mesh.png" ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </CENTER>
<P> The mesh is composed of 500 panels. The body is axi-symmetric.


<H2> Body description </H2>
<P> The body ID is 0
<P> The CoG of the system is assumed to be equal to -l/2 down from the mean water level, where l is the draft of the body
<P> the point of application of the equation of motion, is set to the global position 0,0,0.
<P> The body does not have any parent (-1) and the body coordinate system
<P> is aligned with the global coordinate system. 

<H2> Mass </H2>
<P> The mass of the body is XXX kg, while the inertia tensor is calculated assuming a homogeneous material.

<H2> Modes </H2>
<P> The body is allowed to move only in one degree of freedom, in particular the heave degree of freedom.

<H2> PTO </H2>
<P> The PTO damping in heave is assumed to be YYY N/(m/s)

<H2> Mooring </H2>
<P> The mooring stiffness of the system in heave is assumed to be 0 N/m

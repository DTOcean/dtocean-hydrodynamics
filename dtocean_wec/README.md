## DTOcean Tidal Array Submodule

### Introduction

The main aim of this tool is to generate the hydrodynamic model for the given wec.
The wec is defined using the geometry of structure together with the definition of the
motion modes. The module accept in input also a pre-compiled solution generated by WAMIT or Nemoh.
In order to ease the usage og the DTOcean tool this module is shipped with a database of precompiled 
solution for wec of different shape and functionality.

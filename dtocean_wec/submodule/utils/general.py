def block_diag(*arrs):
    """Create a block diagonal matrix from the provided arrays.

    Given the inputs `A`, `B` and `C`, the output will have these
    arrays arranged on the diagonal::

        [[A, 0, 0],
         [0, B, 0],
         [0, 0, C]]

    If all the input arrays are square, the output is known as a
    block diagonal matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A, B, C, ... : array-like, up to 2D
        Input arrays.  A 1D array or array-like sequence with length n is
        treated as a 2D array with shape (1,n).

    Returns
    -------
    D : ndarray
        Array with `A`, `B`, `C`, ... on the diagonal.  `D` has the
        same dtype as `A`.
